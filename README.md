# Project overview
This project will include basic features such as user authentication, user profiles and articles.


### DAY1
* This project is built to help me practice my skills in building UIs and working on API connectivity between frontend and backend.
* The entire process will be shown here to encourage me to finish this project.
* I explored many resources to understand how a project can automate testing and deployment through CI/CD. This journey helped me simulate a real team workflow, and it gave me more confidence in collaborating with others in future.

### DAY2
* I created basic stores and set up Vue Router today. 
* I also added a simple test and got a feel for the CI workflow. 
* With the help of AI, I drafted a deployment workflow. 
* I don't fully understand the deployment file yet, but I'm digging into them and the YAML syntax.

### DAY3
* I wrote and tested an HTTP request mock.
* I explored some configuration files to get familiar with the basic setup.
* I haven't started writing actual components or logic yet. I'm focusing on getting familiar with the basic structure of a frontend project.
* My CI workflow failed. I created a new account to be my reviewer. However, when I approved the pull request through my new account, the dev branch wasn't merged into the main branch. I'm not sure why this happened, so I decided to disable the rule set temporarily.
