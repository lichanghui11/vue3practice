# Project overview
This project will include basic features such as user authentication, user profiles and articles.


### DAY1
* This project is built to help me practice my skills in building UIs and working on API connectivity between frontend and backend.
* The entire process will be shown here to encourage me to finish this project.
* I explored many resources to understand how a project can automate testing and deployment through CI/CD. This journey helped me simulate a real team workflow, and it gave me more confidence in collaborating with others in future.
